CAEN DRIVER FOR 5780 DIGITISER SERIES

Drivers module for 5780 digitiser are inside the folders "Digitiser_Usb" (usb 
driver) and "Digitiser_Optical_link" (for A3818 PCIe link module); in both cases 
the name of the generated driver is CAENUSBdrv.ko.
Every time that you upgrade the system you have to recompile the drivers and reload
it into the kernel. Steps:

cd (folderof interest) 
- make clean
- make

for kernel versions <= 3.19

log in as root (or use sudo or su -c "your command") and load the kernel typing:
- insmod CAENUSBdrv.ko

check for the presence of the module using:
- lsmod | grep CAEN

Newer kernel versions support only compressed xz modules. xz is a lossless data 
compression program and is normally installed together with the OS. In this case
you have to compress the CAEN driver module by typing:  

- xz CAENUSBdrv.ko

and the CAENUSBdrv.ko.xz module is generated 

log in as root and load the module in the kernel:
- insmod CAENUSBdrv.ko.xz

again you can check for the presence of the module using:
- lsmod | grep CAEN


Copy the CAENUSBdrv.ko.xz into: XRF_Programs/Program_Data_Files since every time 
that you run the XRF_Scanner the starting sequence of the program automatically 
checks if the CAENUSBdrv is loaded for the presence; if it's necessary the program 
loads the driver module.
