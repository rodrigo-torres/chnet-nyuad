A brief, concise document outlining the use of the different flags in the termios structure. Use this guide in case you need to understand and make changes to the protocol which configures the terminal interface properties for the different ma-XRF hardware devices, i.e., the linear stages and Keyence/Arduino serial



0. The termios data strucuture...

Consists of 4 flags controlling the input, output, control and local modes of the terminal interface, and a special characters array usually used for signal processing such as ^Q or ^S for XON/XOFF control or ^C for termination

1. The c_cflag

CSIZE	establishes the size in bits of each character received, choose CS8 for setting 1 character equal to 8 bits.
CSTOPB	adds an extra stop bit, not used.
CREAD	enables input to be read, otherwise is discarded, it is used and important. 
PARENB	enables parity generation on output and parity checking for input, not used.
PARODD	sets whether the parity bit is even or odd, not used.
HUPCL	hangs up the modem connection on last close if set, not used.
CLOCAL	activates (or deactivates) the Data Carrier Detect (CD) signal on the RS-232, not used.

1.1 The baud flag (part of the c_cflag)

The least significant bits of the c_cflag are used to set the baud, these are the standard values plus some other extra output rates and flags not POSIX compliant. These are not used. In case you need to know them

CBAUDEX	a mask enabling the extra baud values
CIBAUD 	enables different values for input baud, not used.
CMSPAR	enables stick parity, not used.
CRTSCTS	enables flow control, not used.

2. The c_lflag
