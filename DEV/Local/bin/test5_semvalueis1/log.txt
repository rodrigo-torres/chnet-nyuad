Posting to semaphore does return the program to expected behaviour.

Procedure to fix crashes with the DPPLib

a. Make sure the DAQ Daemon is not running
1. If the DAQ Daemon is running the daq_is_active flag of the shared memory
will be set to true.
2. Map the shared memory and post false to the daq_enable flag
3. Wait for the process to finish
4. If after waiting the daq_is_active flag does not go to 0, kill the process

The flags in shared_memory guarantee only one instance of the daemon runs at any
given time

Then

b. Make sure there are no issues with the number of CAENDPPLib instances

1. Start an instance of the DPPLibrary to get a library handle
2. If the handle is not zero, call DPPEndLib on all integral numbers below the
value of the library handle
3. Call DPPEndLib on your library handle

c. Make sure the semaphore is working correctly

1. Open the CAEN semaphore and poll the value
2. If the value is not equal to 1, wait or post as needed to return the value to one


Problem fixed
