With a project in eclipse I opened the semaphore found in :

/dev/shm/

Then modified the value of the semaphore to 0. Proceeded with the test and
lo and behold no data was read. Replicating what I had observed before in other
tests of the program. So the issue is no the program is the semaphore when it gets
blocked

Posting the value of 1 on the semaphore again seems to return the program to
expected behaviour?
